    <p>Soon after starting my first job as a UX Designer, I took the oppurtunity to clarify what my role and responsibilities were to be.</p>

<p>UX design sits at the intersection between business and customer. Each has different needs and goals and speaks a different language.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The designers job is to find the overlap between the business and the customer, and push them towards each other.¹</li>
  <li>The designers job is to design with users, not for users. Understanding problems as users see them. Talk to customers about how they achieve their aims, observe how they solves problems.¹</li>
  <li>The designers job is to design with users with the business, not for the business. (?)</li>
  <li>The designers job is to work alongside the product team on preparing just enough for the sprints ahead.²</li>
  <li>The designers job is to collaborate with the developers and share their goal for the sprint.²</li>
  <li>The designers job is to continually research into users needs in order to guide the investigation into possible future product directions.²</li>
  <li>The designer has a committed time allocation of about 60% supporting the sprint and 40% defining the work ahead.³</li>
</ol>

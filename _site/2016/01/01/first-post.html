<p>I’ve long profited from and admired the transparency of other designers. A few that come to mind are <a href="https://frankchimero.com/">Frank Chimero</a>, <a href="https://rsms.me/">Rasmus Anderson</a>, <a href="http://janchipchase.com/">Jan Chipcase</a> and <a href="https://joelcalifa.com">Joel Califa</a>. This small website is a first step for me to do just the same. To kick things off here are 5 benefits I have in mind.</p>
<h4 id="-celebrate-success">① Celebrate success</h4>
<p>Presenting completed work is good way of celebrating success – something that can be rare in the fast paced world of software. It is important to finish anything we do well, and that includes stepping back and saying “that was good”.</p>
<h4 id="-confront-fear">② Confront fear</h4>
<p>What will others think? Will I look silly? The fear of what others think leads to covering up.</p>
<h4 id="-make-connections">③ Make connections</h4>
<p>At best, the act of documenting ones own thoughts and work will be of help to others. At the very least it’ll be easier to get to know me: how I think and what I value.</p>
<h4 id="-look-back-and-learn">④ Look back and learn</h4>
<p>Sadly not everything we do goes well! But even worse is to neglect learning from past failures. Documenting a project forces oneself to look back and learn.</p>
<h4 id="-think-more-clearly">⑤ Think more clearly</h4>
<p>I’m someone who at times has too many interests and ideas rattling around my head. Putting it to paper forces oneself to better understand and clarify a thought. In turn this establishes a habit of clearer communication in general.</p>

In order to match my older notes to the time in which I initialy wrote them I will backdate anything written before April 2021. This post has also been backdated so that it sits at the start of the post list.</h5>

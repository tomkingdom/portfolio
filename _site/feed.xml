Designers who sit within a feature team gain large advantages if they can code. Here are three reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-shared-vocabulary&quot;&gt;‚ù∂ Shared vocabulary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It creates a ‚Äúshared vocabulary between engineering and design‚Äù ¬π. When engineers talk about changes that need to be made and shipping fixes to customers, the design team are no longer left scratching their heads. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-tickets-are-done-quicker&quot;&gt;‚ù∑ Tickets are done quicker&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone does code reviews. Designers now get hands-on when reviewing pull requests, requesting and reviewing screenshots/gifs and sitting with engineers to desk-review implementations. They‚Äôre now creating their own pull requests üí™¬≤.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-small-changes-are-no-longer-blocked-by-busy-engineers&quot;&gt;‚ù∏ Small changes are no longer blocked by busy engineers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be more effective if I didn‚Äôt have to wait for other people‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶I ended up becoming more effective because I was able to ship the small things and fix bugs myself¬≤. Text changes. Translations file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UX design sits at the intersection between business and customer. Each has different needs and goals and speaks a different language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The designers job is to find the overlap between the business and the customer, and push them towards each other.¬π&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The designers job is to design with users, not for users. Understanding problems as users see them. Talk to customers about how they achieve their aims, observe how they solves problems.¬π&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The designers job is to design with users with the business, not for the business. (?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The designers job is to work alongside the product team on preparing just enough for the sprints ahead.¬≤&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The designers job is to collaborate with the developers and share their goal for the sprint.¬≤&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The designers job is to continually research into users needs in order to guide the investigation into possible future product directions.¬≤&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The designer has a committed time allocation of about 60% supporting the sprint and 40% defining the work ahead.¬≥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A few that come to mind are &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankchimero.com/&quot;&gt;Frank Chimero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rsms.me/&quot;&gt;Rasmus Anderson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://joelcalifa.com&quot;&gt;Joel Califa&lt;/a&gt;. It takes bravery to do so – exposing ones own working process and thoughts. But the benefits are many. Here are 5 to start off with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;celebrate-success&quot;&gt;Celebrate success&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By presenting projects one can celebrate success – something rare in the fast paced world of software. It is important to finish anything we do well, and that includes stepping back and saying “that was good”. Writing up a project is a neat way of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;look-back-and-learn&quot;&gt;Look back and learn&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly not everything we do goes well! And even worse, one often neglects learning from past failures. Documenting a project forces one to look back and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;think-clearly&quot;&gt;Think clearly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m someone who at times has too many interests and ideas rattling around my head. Putting it to paper forces oneself to better understand and clarify a thought. In turn this establishes a habit of clearer communication in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;confront-fear&quot;&gt;Confront fear&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working and thinking transparently can be scary. What will others think? Will I look silly? Uncertainty leads to keeping quiet, but being transparent forces oneself to confront those fears. The truth is everyone makes mistakes, yet only by owning up to it can one recieve the critique needed to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;make-friends&quot;&gt;Make friends&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At best, the act of documenting ones own thoughts and work will be of help to others. At the very least it’ll be easier to get to know me: how I think and what I value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In order to match my older notes to the time in which I initialy wrote them I will backdate anything written before April 2021. This post has also been backdated so that it sits at the start of the post list.&lt;/h5&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve long profited from and admired the transparency and writing of other designers.
